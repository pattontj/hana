# What is this?

Hana is a very basic Lisp interpreter built in Rust.


The goal for Hana is to provide a simple and easy to read lisp dialect with the bare essentials for writing basic programs.
The currently planned syntax takes inspiration from bits and pieces of Clojure, Common Lisp, and Fennel. 

## Warning!!!
This project is not intended to be a production-ready language. Use entirely at your own risk.
