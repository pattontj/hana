Functions:
- cons
- read & write
- common list functions like append, push back/front, etc. 
- map, apply, etc.



List functions:
- append
- remove
- push front/back
- map
- apply
- reverse


Type inferencing:
- basic 'is[type]?' for all the built-in type


Macro basics - higher-order helpers:
- equivalent to backquote syntax for list generation
	- Escape ',' and unpack list '@' functions

-

C-FFI:
- Read shared libraries and get valid syms
- Need some common way to bind those .so symbols to hana symbols
	- Need functions to map datatypes in hana to C datatypes



Done:
- progn
- let
- set
- each
- 'list' construction fn
- nth
- last
- len
